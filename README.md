# Convolutional Neural Network for Anthropometric Analysis
Convolutional Neural Network d eveloped using Tensorflow Keras to classify eye images as 'male' or 'female', indicating that the eye belongs to a man or woman, respectively. Data is compressed into **eye_gender_data.rar** and should be extracted first in order to import it and use it within the Jupyter notebook.
