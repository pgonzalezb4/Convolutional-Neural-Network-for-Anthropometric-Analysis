# Convolutional Neural Network for Anthropometric Analysis
Convolutional Neural Network to classify eye images as 'male' or 'female', indicating that the eye is belongs to a man and to a woman, respectively.

Developed using Tensorflow Keras.

(Data is compressed into **eye_gender_data.rar**, in order to import it and use it within the Jupyter notebook it should be extracted first).
